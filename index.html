            <article class="biografija"><h2>The Great American Who..?</h2>
                <p>William Faulkner is considered one of the progenitors of The Great American Novels - canonical works that are thought to embody the essence of that nation, generally dealing in some way with the question of its character.
                <br><br>
                However, Faulkner's greatest asset is the ability to transcend those boundaries. His works speak on the human race as one, inherently flawed, but fascinating mechanism of contradiction and confoundment.</p></article>

                <h2>Master of Modernism</h2>
                <p>Faulkner was one of the most skilled exponents of literary modernism - a movement characterized by a self-conscious break with traditional ways of storytelling. He experimented greatly with literary form and expression.
                    <br><br>In Faulkner's prose one can experience:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>non-linear narratives</li>
                        <li>free-flowing interior monologues</li>
                        <li>unreliable narrators</li>
                        <li>intricate wordplay and atypical narrative forms</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2> Visit a place that doesn't exist!</h2>
                <p><strong>Yoknapatawpha County</strong> (/jɒknəpə'tɔ:fə/) is a fictional Mississippi county created by Faulkner to set the majority of his novels and short stories in.
                    It is one of the most intricate literary universes ever created, with a consistent geography, detailed history, family genealogies and even linguistic quirks and idiolects. 
                    This 'Faulknerverse' connects characters and events over time and space, even if they themselves don't overlap.</p>
